# Investigating-a-Dataset
You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers.

Known all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
Been comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
Known how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
An experience communicating the results of your analysis
Been able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
Beeen familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
Known how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
